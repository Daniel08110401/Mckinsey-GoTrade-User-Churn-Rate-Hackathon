# Mckinsey Hackathon: GoTrade User Churn Rate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the McKinsey Hackathon and focuses on analyzing and predicting user churn rates for the Go-Trade platform. By examining data from 500 sample users, we've gained insights into the factors contributing to churn and developed a predictive model with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Churn Rate Analysis**: In-depth analysis of user churn rates based on a dataset of 500 sample users.
- **Data Processing**: Extensive data exploration, cleaning, and validation using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementation of an XGBoost model to predict churn rates.
- **Insightful Findings**: Identification of key factors influencing churn, such as deposit & withdrawal frequency, stock holding periods, and meme-stock trading patterns.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a 92.5% accuracy in predicting user churn, showcasing robust data analysis and machine learning capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- XGBoost

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to access the Jupyter Notebook files.
